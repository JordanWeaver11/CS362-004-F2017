Title:	Bugs in Teammate Code

Date:			11/19/2017
Reported By:	Jordan Weaver

Code Tested: dominion.c
----------------------------------
----------------------------------

==================================
BUG1: Draws 2 cards instead of 3

Dominion Function:	smithy_function()
Test File:			cardtest1.c

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
Played the smithy card. Expected to draw 3 cards, but only drew 2.
A loop counter in the smithy_function must be set to 2 instead of 3.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
I initialized the game, put the smithy card in the player's hand,
and called the playCard() function on the smithy card. Then I 
subtracted the old number of cards in the current player's hand from
the new number of cards in the current player's hand. See cardtest1.c 
for more specific game initialization.


Expected Results
----------------
The current player should have 3 new cards in his hand.


Actual Results
--------------
The current player has only 2 cards in his hand.


Workarounds
-----------
No workaround, but changing the loop counter on line 1377 of dominion.c
should fix the problem. Change to i < 3.

=========================================
BUG2: Draws 1 treasure instead of 2

Dominion Function:	adventure_function()
Test File:			cardtest2.c

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
Played the adventurer card, expected to draw 2 treasures, but only drew 1.
A loop counter in the adventure_function must be set to 1 instead of 2.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
I initialized the game, put the adventurer card in the current player's hand, 
and called the playCard() function on the adventurer card. Then I subtracted 
the old number of treasure cards from the new number of treasure cards in 
the current player's hand. See cardtest2.c for more specific game initialization.

Expected Results
----------------
Expected 2 new treasure cards in the current player's hand.

Actual Results
--------------
Only 1 new treasure card in the current player's hand.

Workarounds
-----------
No workaround, but changing the loop counter on line 1349 of dominion.c 
should fix the problem.
